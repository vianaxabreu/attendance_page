# 📊 Student Attendance Tracker with GitHub Authentication

## Project Overview
A web-based attendance system designed to automate and simplify student attendance collection using GitHub login, QR codes, and Google Sheets integration.

## Problem Statement
Traditional attendance methods are inefficient, error-prone, and tedious. This project provides a digital solution where students authenticate with their GitHub accounts and their attendance is logged automatically into a Google Sheet, complete with timestamps and session identifiers.

## 🏗️ Solution Architecture

### 🔐 Authentication
Students securely authenticate via GitHub OAuth, ensuring verified identities without extra accounts or passwords.

### 🌐 Frontend
A minimal, responsive web interface hosted on **GitHub Pages** enables students to log in and mark attendance quickly.

### ⚙️ Backend
Developed with **Flask (Python)** and deployed on **Google Cloud Run** for scalable and reliable backend services.

### 📄 Data Logging
On successful login, the following data is recorded in a Google Sheet:
- GitHub Username
- Timestamp
- QR Session Code

### 🔲 QR Code Integration
A unique QR code is generated per session. Scanning this code initiates the login process and attaches a session-specific identifier to the attendance log.

## ✅ Current Status
The project is actively under development. Core features like GitHub login, attendance logging, and QR code flow are functional. Work in progress includes:
- Enhanced session management
- User interface improvements
- Additional security layers
